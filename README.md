This is my mobile application development module (CTEC3911) coursework for De Montfort University 

The task is to create a Coffee Shop mobile application coded in Kotlin Programming Language for the back-end and XML for the front-end.

My coffee shop is called "Caf√© Oasis".

Other tools used: 
- Android Studio: Make the mobile application and test it using Android Virtual Device (Android Emulator)
- Google Images: Get images for products on my coffee shop menu
- Paint.NET: Edit the images retrieved from Google Images so they can be inserted into the SQLite Database
- DB Browser for SQLite
