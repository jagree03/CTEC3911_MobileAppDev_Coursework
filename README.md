This is my mobile application development module (CTEC3911) coursework for De Montfort University 

The task is to create a Coffee Shop mobile application coded in Kotlin Programming Language for the back-end and XML for the front-end.

My coffee shop is called "Caf√© Oasis".

Other tools used: 
- Android Studio: Make the mobile application and test it using Android Virtual Device (Android Emulator)
- Google Images: Get images for products on my coffee shop menu
- Paint.NET: Edit the images retrieved from Google Images so they can be inserted into the SQLite Database
- DB Browser for SQLite


Grade: 60.75 / 100 (61 %)

Due to lack of time, I did not complete all the features of the application such as implementing a notifications system or allowing the administrator to view customer supplied feedback records and more. I hope to fully complete this system in my own time.
